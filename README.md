# Qualys

## Description

In this project, I will go through the process of installing a Qualys Virtual Scanner Appliance, which will be access through the Qualys Cloud Platform. Once configured, I will scan a Windows virtual machine, remediate the vulnerabilities and verify the VM is no longer vulnerable. 

<b>Note:</b> This is utilizing the Qualys Community Edition.
